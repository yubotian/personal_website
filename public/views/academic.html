  <h1>Coding</h1>
  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Project</h2>
  My code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/yubotian">Github profile</a>. Some of my work are in private repositories and they are available upon request. The projects that I have done in and out of school includes
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>My website (which you're browsing!)</li>
      <ul>
      <li>I made this personal website using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. </li>
      <li>Normally building a personal web page doesn't require Node.js or MongoDB for backend, but I always wanted to learn building webapp using full MEAN stack. </li>
      <li>So here we are! This is an interactive webapp with registration/authentication system.(much like twitter, but I hide the register button!)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <li>Gym Buddy</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Swift, Objective-C, MySQL</li>
      <li>An iOS app that pairs up workout buddies according to requests and fitness habits.</li>
      <li>Finding a workout partner has become harder for colelge students due to the diverse lifestyles and time schedules, This is the problem that I want to solve with this app. I worked with a three people group, led the UI/UX design process and database implementation.
       <li>I also constructed the Storyboards, view controllers and model classes for query matching view and profile/history sports records and implemented ranking algorithms and protection against SQLi.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <li>Solutions to over 100 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) problems on <a href="https://github.com/yubotian/ICPC_practice">github</a></li>
    
  </ul>

    <h1>Biology and Computational Genomics</h1>
    While being a CS major, biology has also been my long-time fascination. I am interested in research that explores the "marriage" of these two beautiful subjects, i.e., computational genomics and bioinfomatics.
